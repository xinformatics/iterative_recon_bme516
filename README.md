# iterative_recon_bme516
## contains Python code for iterative reconstruction with several variants.

### 1: 01_Original_Python_Code.ipynb : Implementation of the MATLAB program in Python.
### 2: 02_Residual_Computation_Threshold_Stopping.ipynb : Computing the residual artifact (e.g., signal level in the background area) across those 200 iterations and plotting? This notebook also contains Early stopping of the reconstruction loop if the signal does not improve by some threshold percentage.
### 3: 03_Residual_Computation_Thresold_Stopping_More_Noise.ipynb : In this notebook, two k-space lines are corrupted with 100x high value of the artifact. Rest is same as notebook 2.
